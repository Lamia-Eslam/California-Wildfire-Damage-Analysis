# California-Wildfire-Damage-Analysis
**Data Analytics Project**

Wildfires in California have caused extensive destruction, resulting in financial losses, property damage, and human casualties. This project focuses on analyzing the California Wildfire Damage Dataset (2014 â€“ February 2025) to uncover key trends, assess wildfire impacts, and provide data-driven insights for disaster management, risk assessment, and policy-making.

The dataset includes records of wildfire incidents across California, containing details such as:
- Incident ID, date, and location
- Area burned (in acres)
- Cause of wildfire (human activity, lightning, unknown)
- Financial losses (estimated cost of destruction in Million $)
- Businesses, homes, and vehicles affected
- Casualties (injuries and fatalities)
By analyzing these patterns, we aim to:
- Identify wildfire trends over time and across locations.
- Assess the financial impact on businesses, properties, and infrastructure.
- Analyze wildfire causes and their contribution to damage severity.
- Visualize insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

Methodology & Tools
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Database & Querying: SQL Server
- Visualization: Tableau
This project will provide researchers, policymakers, and emergency management teams with valuable insights into wildfire patterns and financial impacts, supporting more effective risk mitigation and resource planning.
